   <figcaption style="font-size:30px;">63km of ice, carving it’s way through the Karakoram Mountain range in Gilgit-Baltistan, Baltoro is one of the longest glaciers in the world.
Its wide trough carves through steep mountains, with smaller glacier valleys creeping to the side along the way. Not surprisingly, it is a popular trekking destination, a jumping off point to mountaineering destinations like K2, Broad Peak, and the Gasherbrum peaks at its head.
Its meltwater nurtures the lush valleys of Northern Pakistan. To see it for yourself, approach the glacier from the Balti town of Skardu.</figcaption>

<figcaption style="font-size:30px;"> emerald green gem, nestled in the craggy snow-capped peaks of Azad Kashmir: it’s no surprise that the Neelum Valley takes its name after a precious stone.
A lost world of verdant forests, burbling streams and luscious pastures, it is veritable oasis in the dry north – a place where people live simple lives, nourished by the livestock and crops that flourish here.
The best time to go is when is the sun is out. Visit in summer and you’ll be treated to a feast of apples, apricots, walnuts and plums that the valley is famous for.</figcaption>

<figcaption style="font-size:30px;">National Park is a place of otherworldly beauty: an inhospitable lunar landscape, running along the Makran Coast to the west of Karachi.
The elements have carved the Hingol’s rocks into mystical shapes – princesses, sphinxes and whatever else your imagination can conjure up – and a cluster of active mud volcanoes burble and splutter near an azure sea.
The park is known for its diverse wildlife, too. Eagle-eyed watchers can spotSindh leopards, chinkaras, honey badgers and Indian pangolins.</figcaption>
